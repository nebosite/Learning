Planted Flag

Planted Flag is an application/toy I created to get back into C++ coding. My beautiful, 
easy-to-read source code is available at www.ericjorgensen.com. You can 
browse it to see a wide range of classes and utility or to get a feel for my coding style. 
Pretty much all the functionality to be seen is hand-written. The only libraries I 
use are math.h for sqrt,sin, & cos and the windows console API to work with the 
low-level console functionality.

Planted Flag has the following features:
	Physics Engine
		Simulation of springs, wind, drag, turbulence, and gravity
		2nd order Runge Kutter solver - pretty stable
		Real-time controls
	3D graphics tools - Objects, Transformation Matrices, Vectors
	Text Console rendering engine
		Lines, points, text, and color
		Mouse manipulation
		Widget controls
	Mathematics concepts employed
		n-Body Physics simulation
		Runge Kutte Ordinary Differential Equation solver
		Spring force calculations
		Perlin Noise to simulate turbulence
		Viscous Drag and gravity simulation
		Matrix and Vector math
		3D transformations
	C++ classes and concepts in use:
		Matrices & Vectors
		Polymorphism (Widget classes)
		Dictionary/Hash table
		Linked Lists
		Animation Loop

Enjoy!
