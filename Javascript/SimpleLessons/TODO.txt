Ideas for projects
    [ ] Linear keyboard racing game
    [ ] Number guessing game with a simple form  (pictures and sound, maybe)
    [ ] Very basic text dungeon.  Simple commands: directions, get, drop, inventory
    [ ] Tile game walk around and collect


TODO
    [ ] Figure out if there is a way to draw SVG files, if so, how can we make svgs?
    [ ] When making lessons, be sure to add links for additional learning


DONE
